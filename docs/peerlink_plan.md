# PeerLink Implementation Plan (Phase 3 MVP)

## Overview
Implement gRPC-based PeerLink component for secure peer-to-peer communication between EventMesh nodes. Focus on MVP simplicity while addressing all 8 requirements from design.md.

## Key Simplifications for MVP
- **mTLS deferred**: Use plain gRPC for MVP (mTLS in post-MVP as per design.md)
- **Single stream per peer**: No multi-stream complexity
- **Simple backoff**: Exponential backoff without advanced jitter algorithms
- **Basic metrics**: Essential observability without complex tracing
- **Static peer lists**: No dynamic peer discovery
- **In-memory state**: No persistence of peer state/offsets

## Implementation Phases

### **Phase 3.1: Protobuf & gRPC Foundation** ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Create protobuf schema and generate gRPC code using TDD approach

**Sub-Phases (Small TDD Batches):**

#### **Phase 3.1a: Configuration Component** ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Created `Config` struct with validation and defaults
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests (2 tests passing)
- ✅ Clean TDD cycle: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → COMMIT
- ✅ **Committed**: e382109 - PeerLink Phase 3.1: Add Configuration Component (TDD)

#### **Phase 3.1b: Protobuf Schema** ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Created `proto/peerlink/v1/peerlink.proto` with exact schema from design.md
- ✅ Added gRPC dependencies to go.mod
- ✅ Ready for code generation

#### **Phase 3.1c: Protobuf Code Generation** ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Generate working Go gRPC code and verify compilation
**Tasks:**
1. ✅ Updated protobuf schema to align with EventLog (removed partitions, added headers)
2. ✅ Generated Go gRPC client/server code from protobuf
3. ✅ Created comprehensive tests verifying message creation and schema changes
4. ✅ Fixed basic example to work with topic-scoped EventLog API
5. ✅ **Committed**: e5eb829 - Phase 1: Update protobuf schema to match EventLog and design spec

#### **Phase 3.1d: Basic GRPCPeerLink Structure** ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Create minimal GRPCPeerLink struct with interface compliance
**Tasks:**
1. ✅ Created interface compliance test
2. ✅ Created basic `GRPCPeerLink` struct
3. ✅ Implemented minimal interface methods (return "not implemented" errors)
4. ✅ Made interface compliance test pass
5. ✅ Basic structure working and tested

#### **Phase 3.1e: Constructor and Lifecycle** ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Add constructor and basic lifecycle methods
**Tasks:**
1. ✅ Created tests for `NewGRPCPeerLink` and `Close()`
2. ✅ Implemented constructor with config validation
3. ✅ Implemented basic `Close()` method
4. ✅ All tests passing with proper lifecycle management

### **Phase 3.2: Basic Connection Lifecycle (REQ-PL-001)** ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Establish single bidirectional gRPC streams per peer

**Simple Implementation:**
- **Connection deduplication**: Simple rule - higher `node_id` wins as dialer
- **Reconnection**: Basic exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, max 30s)
- **Handshake**: Exchange `node_id` and `protocol_version` only (no feature negotiation yet)
- **Graceful shutdown**: Close stream and wait for in-flight sends with timeout

**Key Components:**
- `PeerConnection` struct managing single gRPC stream per peer
- `ConnectionManager` handling peer lifecycle and deduplication
- Basic retry logic with `time.Sleep()` and context cancellation

### **Phase 3.3: Message Flow & Bounded Queues (REQ-PL-002)** ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Implement bounded send queue to prevent memory growth (per design.md REQ-PL-002)

**Simple Implementation (MVP):**
- **Bounded send queue**: Add configurable queue size to GRPCPeerLink (default 100)
- **Drop policy**: Block with timeout, then drop oldest or newest (configurable)
- **Basic metrics**: Track queue depth and drops with simple counters
- **Keep sending as stub**: Queue messages but don't implement actual gRPC streaming yet

**Scope:**
- Modify `SendEvent()` to use bounded queue instead of immediate return
- Add queue management (block, timeout, drop policies)
- Add basic metrics tracking
- **Defer**: Actual gRPC streaming implementation (Phase 3.4+)

### **Phase 3.4: Heartbeats & Health Monitoring (REQ-PL-003)** ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Basic failure detection (per design.md REQ-PL-003)

**Simple Implementation:**
- **Health states**: Healthy/Unhealthy/Disconnected per peer
- **Failure detection**: 3 consecutive missed heartbeats = mark peer Unhealthy
- **Heartbeat timing**: Configurable interval (default 5s, range 2s-10s per design)
- **Basic logging**: Log state transitions for observability

**Scope:**
- Add health state and failure counting to existing peer tracking
- Add methods: `GetPeerHealth(peerID)` and `SetPeerHealth(peerID, state)`
- Keep heartbeat sending as stub (don't implement actual periodic sending yet)
- **Defer**: Actual heartbeat protocol, complex state machine, "event emission"

### ~~**Phase 3.5: At-Least-Once Delivery (REQ-PL-004)**~~ ❌ **DROPPED FROM MVP**
**Rationale**: Too complex for MVP - requires deep EventLog integration, persistent state management, and complex replay logic. This is a perfect post-MVP feature that can be added once the basic mesh is working.

### **Phase 3.6: Configuration & Observability (REQ-PL-006, REQ-PL-007)** ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Extend existing Config with queue/heartbeat settings (per design.md REQ-PL-007)

**Extended Config (build on existing):**
- ✅ All required config fields already present (SendQueueSize, HeartbeatInterval, SendTimeout)
- ✅ Added comprehensive config tests including value preservation
- ✅ Verified defaults match design spec (100 queue, 1s timeout, 5s heartbeat)

**Basic Metrics (REQ-PL-006):**
- ✅ Added PeerMetrics struct with JSON serialization for monitoring
- ✅ Implemented GetAllPeerMetrics() for aggregate metrics collection
- ✅ Comprehensive metrics tests covering queue depth, drops, health states
- ✅ All metrics working correctly for multiple peers with different states

**Completed:**
- Enhanced config validation and testing with 17 total tests passing
- Basic observability ready for monitoring integration
- **Committed**: bfea38f - Phase 3.6: Configuration & Observability

### **Phase 3.7: Final Integration** ⏳
**Goal**: Combine all phases into working PeerLink component

**Simple Integration:**
- Ensure all interface methods work together
- Basic end-to-end test (start server, connect peers, send events)
- Verify all implemented requirements (REQ-PL-001 through REQ-PL-007)

**Scope:**
- Keep testing incremental (done in each phase)
- **Defer**: Advanced integration testing, performance benchmarks, failure injection
